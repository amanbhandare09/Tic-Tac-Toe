#Tic-tac-Toe
This program is a Tic-tac-toe game for 2 players. Consider a 3*3 matrix and number the 9 squares as 1 to 9.
To play the game, Player 1 has to enter a number between 1-9 where 'X' will be placed. Next, Player 2 will play for 'O'.
If a player manages to put 3 X or O in a straight line (Horizontal, vertical or Diagonal), the player WINS the game.
If no player manages to do so, it's a DRAW.
